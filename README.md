# NDI

The project is a mobile based PWA application. For test deployment it uses Cordova emulator, built for Android.

Due to a press for time, the repository contains only documentation (NDI Documentation) describing the proposed problem statement etc. and a very simple UI flow using basic HTML and CSS. I wasn't able to structure any backend structure that would be integrated with the NDI product API due to time constraint as well.

Apologies for the simple work, I hope it would not affect it too negatively. I really appreciate the opportunity given!
