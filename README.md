# NDI

The project is a mobile based PWA application. For test deployment it uses Cordova emulator, built for Android.

Due to a press for time this week, the repository contains only documentation (NDI Documentation) describing the proposed problem statement etc. and a very simple UI flow using basic HTML and CSS. I wasn't able to create any backend structure that would be integrated with the NDI product API due to time constraint as well.

Apologies for the simple work, I have really appreciated the opportunity given!
